College is average according to the package. The average package here in mechanical engineering is about 3-4 LPA. Many average and some good companies visit the campus, but not all students get a good package on campus, it is decent according to the cut-off. Nestled, Wipro, Tata Motors, TCS, and HDFC Life companies like this have picked students from our college with a good package, but it can also be off-campus.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure is very good, classrooms are also decent, but the auditorium hall is small, according to the college and the number of students. The hostel is very good, security and cleanliness are good in the hostel, but the mess is not that good. For events and sports, the college hosts many cultural events, sports tournaments of BGMI, like game downloads, that happen on campus.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty are not that good, but some teachers are really good and passionate about their job. The college conducts many exhibitions for students to make some creative projects and gives prizes to those who participate. The course curriculum is relevant, and students get ready. The difficulty of the semester is not that hard, but if you have some knowledge and are decent students, you can easily score well on the exam just by smart studying 2-3 days before the exam.",
              "Other": "I am pursuing a BE in mechanical engineering, and I chose this course because I love robotics and automation. Actually, this college is not good for core branches like mechanical, civil, and electrical, but it is slowly getting better in that. CS aids like branches are better in this college. Many events, festivals, and extracurricular activities happen in large numbers. Scholarship is also good."

Mostly, the company doesn't take mass recruitment from the college. The highest package that I know is somewhere around 50 LPA. The good thing is that college provides placement preparation. The lowest I would say was around 5 LPA.",
              "Infrastructure": "The college has good infrastructure, but it doesn't seem to work every time. For example, we have Wi-Fi everywhere in college, but it doesn't give the desired speed for completing your work. The classrooms and library are good. The hostel infrastructure is good, but guests have the same problem of not having good facilities. Even the mess food is not included in the hostel, so you have to buy it. Medical facilities are not that good, but they will work.",
              "Faculty": "The teachers are the best assets of the institution. They are all highly qualified, supportive, and readily available to help students succeed. The coursework is also effective, preparing you well for the relevant industry. While the exams are difficult and require significant effort, you SEE this rigour as a positive challenge that motivates hard work. The unique passing criteria, which require you to pass all three individual semester exams, ensure high standards are maintained.",
              "Other": "I chose this course by looking into the future, as I say, in the coming time, there will be a vast demand for this. The things that colleges need to improve are their internet connectivity. Then come the college events, which ensure that there is a good amount of events and other activities around the college."

However, I wish the course had more elective options and updated some lab equipment. The campus is lively with diverse events, fests, and extracurricular activities. The atmosphere is friendly, the connectivity to Pune is good, and scholarship opportunities are available for deserving students."

Most students are graduated from college and few of them got chance to work as interns abroad. It was one of the top-ranked colleges, especially for its placement works. (Specialized for MBA).",

Also, some students from the other states were studying here, and they were helped with the required needs.",

The teachers are helpful, qualified, and knowledgeable. The course curriculum is relevant, and it makes the students industry-ready as they provide the training program in the last year of college before the placement and interviews.",

The difficulty level of end semester is 3/5, which means moderately difficult, but still many students are unaware and have failed the exams.",

The professors and teachers who are there to help at any time is the best thing about this course in my opinion. This course provides us with a lot of good things and resources so a better course than this wasn't possible. Cultural fests and events take place regularly on our campus which de-stresses the students and they are really good. The campus is located near the hills, so connectivity from one place to another will require you to go through hill areas and muddy roads, but the municipal corporation is trying to improve the connectivity. The campus surroundings are really beautiful and become requisite especially in the monsoon season."

The library is quite huge, and it has comfortable chairs. We can issue books anytime. It's pretty nice. The hostel rooms are nice. The only problem is that sometimes it comes with poor water management. Hot water is sometimes not available for bathing. But overall, everything is good. Wardens are helpful.",
              "Faculty": "In the biotechnology department, teachers are very good. Professors are above average. Exams are quite difficult, but teachers help us a lot with them.

It is all very helpful for students. The thing that could get better is that the class timings are quite long. Many events and fests are organised. It's a good opportunity to participate and increase our experience and networking."

Top recruiting companies are Flipkart, Kotak, Zee Media, Aaj Tak, etc. Internships are for everyone, but they are not in very good companies. Reporter and anchor are some top roles offered in our course. The highest salary package offered is 8 LPA. The lowest salary package offered is 2 LPA.",
              "Infrastructure": "The campus is not very big. There are labs and different practical rooms for different programs and departments. We have a studio for practicals. Other than that everything is okay. The canteen is based on the tender. They give yearly tenders to different restaurants and brands.",
              "Faculty": "Our teachers are very helpful and qualified. Exams are very difficult. Our course curriculum is relatable. We got a lot of exposure there. This college makes students industry-ready by providing them with internships on a regular basis but you will get to do internships in the 2nd year.",
              "Other": "Our batch is very good. I wanted to do journalism but now I am into PR. Many events are held on campus."

              "Placements": "So, in 2023, the highest placement was 44 LPA by Human Company, which is a Japanese-based company, and in 2024, placement is ongoing. About 28 students got placed out of 60 in BCA, and many of them are going for further studies or starting/continuing their business. So, according to that, the placement rate is good. Many companies like Amazon, Yandex, Infosys, TCS, and many more came to hire in Amity University Ranchi.",
              "Infrastructure": "Facilities are given in the campus, such as well-updated labs with new technology and Wi-Fi all over the campus. Currently, the campus is under construction, so there are some limitations. If the campus is completed, the facilities will increase. Currently, the new campus is only given to the new batch, which is from 2024, so I have no idea about that.",
              "Faculty": "Amity University Ranchi teachers are well-qualified, and there is no shortage of teachers. They are currently hiring more teachers for teaching, and every teacher has prior experience in the industry or MNCs, so they know how to teach and how to crack any interview. They teach according to that. Exams in Amity are not very hard, but you have to study."

I'm just studying in third year, so I don't know much about placements. But our college has good placements. The faculty members provide hands-on practice instead of just theories a lot, so it helps you upgrade your skills and get placed easily.",

If you want to join the hostel, think twice before joining. Most of the students get skin problems because of the bad water and unhygienic environment in the hostel.",

              "Infrastructure": "The college provides good facilities for our department, including smart classrooms, fast Wi-Fi, and well-equipped computer labs. The library is quiet and stocked with useful study material. Hostels are clean and have basic amenities. The food in the mess is average, while the canteen offers a better variety.

Overall, the infrastructure is decent and supports both academics and student life well.",

Almost all students pass the exams, exam difficulties are average.",
              "Other": "I think new subjects like web development and AI should be taught from the 1st semester instead of Chemistry, etc. There are a lot of rules, regulations, and restrictions in college, most students don't like them, but these rules make students very disciplined in their careers. A lot of competition is always going on with cash prizes and all."

Permanent teachers are the best and knowledgeable, but the quality of temporary teaching may vary.

The semester exams are not that hard one can clear them in a day itself, but they need smart work. Pass percentage is 90%.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because of the placements in computer engineering. The best things are that the syllabus is easy and the teachers in our department are qualified and competent. Things that could be improved are the hands-on experience with the industry and also the practical knowledge, because currently it focuses on theoretical knowledge. There are many events conducted in the college, like Amethyst, Aakriti, Pace, sports, etc. Fest is the amethyst which has many events like a battle of bands, dance groups, etc. From various colleges like AFMC, MIT, COEP, etc."

Teaching quality ranges from average to excellent, though methods are mostly traditional. The curriculum covers core civil engineering areas but feels slightly outdated; students often self-learn modern tools like AutoCAD and STAAD Pro. Practical exposure is limited, so internships and certification are recommended for skill development. Semester exams are moderately difficult and largely theory-based, with an 85-90% pass rate. Internal assessment and attendance significantly impact final grades. Overall, the programme builds strong fundamentals but requires extra effort to achieve full industry readiness.",

BIT Sindri offers experienced faculty, strong core placements (JSW, Vedanta, Aditya Birla), and affordable fees.

Active student societies like the Civil Engineering Society and ISTE enrich learning. The popular annual fest SRIJAN features technical and cultural events.

              "Faculty": "Teachers are helpful and supportive. Their teaching quality is good, and the college organizes various helpful sessions. Questions in semester exams vary from easy to moderate levels. You can pass the exam with just one night of studying, but to achieve good marks, you need to focus on your studies.",
              "Other": "The college fee is around Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 70,000. The alumni network is strong, aiding students in securing internships at reputable companies. A significant issue is the old infrastructure and the fact that much of the lab equipment is unused. There are no major events but various small events do occur. There are no big events."

Limited numbers of spots are for core placements, and the majority are from IT and consulting companies such as TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and Capgemini. The majority of the top positions offered are for a software developer, system engineer, and business analyst. Placements overall are enhancing but need more company diversity and presence from the core sector.",
              "Infrastructure": "Infrastructure at BIT Sindri is average. Classrooms and labs are functional but typically lack contemporary equipment and maintenance. Wi-Fi is available but not consistently reliable. There is a good collection of academic textbooks in the library, though digital material is lacking. Hostel infrastructure is planned, with shared rooms and shared washrooms. Cleanliness and water supply are an issue at times. The mess is tolerable but lacks quality and diversity. There are sports facilities in the form of grounds and basic indoor games, though equipment and maintenance are subpar.",
              "Faculty": "The teaching faculty at BIT Sindri are knowledgeable for the most part, though the teaching style is pretty conventional and not very interactive. Some of the faculty members are cooperative, or else the teaching quality is not up to the mark. The curriculum is average and a bit outdated, with not much practical exposure and industry focus. The semester exams are fairly tough, and the pass percentage is reasonable, i.e., 70%. Students would be hugely benefited by the focus on updated course material and practical learning.",
              "Other": "I opted for civil engineering at BIT Sindri (2024-2028 batch) for its sound academic curriculum and qualified faculty. The course material in the required subjects is covered well, with adequate facilities in the labs. However for civil, there are not many placements, and there is a desire for increased industry exposure and technical workshops. Campus life is ordinary. Bitotsav, Techfest, and FOYC events do occur, though there needs to be more involvement from the students. Hostel and mess facilities are simple yet functional. Overall, it is a good value-for-money institution, particularly for government exam students."

              "Placements": "In my course, around 80% students were placed last year. The highest package is around 33 LPA and the average is 10.4 LPA. Top recruiting companies are Deloitte, HCL Technologies, and Hero Group. 73% of students got internships last year, and the companies were the same as mentioned above. Top roles offered are full-stack software developer, game developer, IoT engineer, etc.",
              "Infrastructure": "There are various facilities available in my course. We have Wi-Fi all over the campus and a 72GB weekly limit per student. Classrooms are fine and have a decent amount of space. We have a huge and very informative library. The quality of hostel rooms is nice, and they are cleaned regularly. Mess serves decent food that is edible and we have a variety of stalls and shops on our campus. We have 24-hour availability in medical services, and there are a lot of sports that you can indulge yourself in, like basketball, cricket, football, archery, badminton, chess, billiards, etc.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are helpful, and we have some faculty members who have a Ph.D. degree from abroad, and they have a lot of knowledge that they share with us. All teachers are good at what they teach. This course not only serves us with normal theoretical knowledge but also helps with practical skills and makes us ready for the industry, as it provides industry visits too. Semester exams have a relevant amount of difficulty that assesses your skills and knowledge. The pass percentage is approximately 91%, which is quite good.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because I was enthusiastic about computers and software, which is why I wanted to do something that is related to my interests. The best thing about this course is that they not only provide theoretical knowledge but also teach hands-on skills that are required for a student of this course. The only thing I think needs to be better is proper distribution of evaluation all over the semester, and not only forcing all of them in the end before the end-semester exams. A lot of events take place regularly."

A small hospital is there for small health issues.",

The hostel is pretty decent, and can adjust. Food quality is also okay. Sports infrastructure is very good, but they will get very little time to play.",

As a day scholar, I can't tell about hostel facilities, but it has a canteen and more quick bite places with hygienic conditions and good food.

Teaching quality is also excellent as they help students with every problem, just like mentors and motivate them towards studies. Like its first batch of University, the course is similar to that of IKGPTU for the first semester, and we know the first semester builds the basics of Maths and programming. End-of-semester exams are currently happening, and in my view, the level of difficulty in exams is moderate.",

Also, it focuses on financially weak students by providing them with scholarships, like this year, the Institute itself provides scholarships worth 25 crores. As the first semester follows the syllabus similar to that of IKGPTU, I think that they should make their own, the latest, industry-related syllabus, so that students get easily placed by gaining industry-related skills. Events here are also very awesome, like Saviskar'25 happened just a few months ago, with both cultural and technical events, and also celebrity performances. Green surroundings make it good."

While some of faculty teach with real examples and clarity, others rely heavily on PPTs and smart screens. Term exams are conducted 2 times every semester with an end semester examination. It also contains lab exams for respective branch students with specializations. The curriculum is fairly standard for a JNTU-affiliated college. Some subjects are outdated but are useful.",

The pass percentage in the last semester is around 75%, as far as I know.",

As everyone says, AI is the future, and I share the same opinion and try to master it. I am currently in the 4th semester and have already started learning the required basics to excel in AI. Fests and events take place frequently in our college. They provide a friendly atmosphere for everyone. There is also a subject based on CEER, which encourages innovation among students."

The most important step of the placement interview is the test conducted by the interviewer. Students should well prepare the Logical Reasoning, Verbal Ability, and Quantitative Awareness topics.

Top recruiting companies used to visit like Deloitte, Cognizant, Wipro, TCS, Tech Mahindra, Accenture, and DXC. Top roles are software developer and web designer for those who are qualified enough. The highest package is 44 LPA, and the lowest package is 2.5 LPA. The average package salary is 4 LPA.",

College has boys hostel but it cost Rs 10,000 a month so better to choose outside hostel. Food is available all day, and it can be eaten happily with no regret of fee. Chicken is provided twice a week.",
              "Faculty": "Exams are not very easy but can be cracked. But the correction of papers is very based as per my observation. Lab marks are given according to favoritism. The curriculum is totally different from what is required for real-world experience. They teach something else, and we have to qualify for something else in placement exams.",
              "Other": "During the time of placements, the students are divided into batches, and only a few batches are favoured by the placement cell. The placement coordinator, Ch Madhav sir is just concerned about the count of placements but he is never scared about the work role and reputation of a hiring company."

But they could not even teach proper programming in labs, if a student found an error. Teachers also could not solve it. Semester exams were the worst, they failed most of the students for money.",

So it gives an edge. Extra classes are organised for students. The course curriculum is a bit outdated, but professors bring a lot of new topics for discussion. Pedagogy is also a bit outdated, considering the fact that lots of other MBA institutes have an innovative style of teaching. Some courses are offered on a specific campus, so it creates a lot of convenience for students to travel to different campuses."

No student got an internship. Junior Engineer & Site Engineer are the most preferred jobs available. This is the problem for everyone who is from a Tier 3 college. I am facing the same issue. The campus package is not more than 3 Lacs per annum. I was feeling very bad asking pass-out seniors about jobs. Then someone gave me a wise suggestion: He told me to find a good company, not a big company. Let me explain, I am a machine learning enthusiast, and he told me to find a startup that is working on data science and machine learning. Don’t worry about salary. It may be very less, but in that organization, you will get the best work experience. Your learning curve will be vertical. Believe me, you will see a wide difference in yourself after 1 year because in a startup, you have to work professionally on your own for a long time (1-1.5 years). After that, you can start applying for big corporates. Now your confidence and professional skills will help you to crack any interview. Don’t waste time or spend a year to find a high-paying job. Or else, if you have good enough skills that fulfill the requirements of big corporates, then definitely you can apply now.",

Semester exams are quite tough, but still, students manage to clear the exams. The passing percentage is around 70-80%. For most of us, college is the first time you’re living away from home, and it takes a lot of getting used to. I’m beginning to wonder if it’s all just a concocted ruse to become industry specialists in the fine art of doing one’s own laundry. But when you’re delivered at the hostel doorstep, starry-eyed and full of cinematic visions of giant groups of friends, crazy nights, and all kinds of hi-jinks you’d probably be telling your kids about someday, no one tells you that not everyone enjoys college. All my life, I’d always attended private schools in cities where people were more or less similar, and you quickly found your type and settled in. Being relatively cosmopolitan, cultural or religious differences didn’t really matter because you couldn’t see how the person in front was different from you.",

Otherwise, they are difficult, and the pass percentage is 98%.",

A lot can be improved in our course like our college should focus more on practical approach. We should study the latest technology rather than the old one which has been outdated. Every year our college organises a tech-fest named Techzuberent. Our college is well connected through the railway station, main road and airport."

              "Infrastructure": "Good infrastructure for fees. Good Wi-Fi facilities, labs, and library. Quality food in the mess and canteen. But a dispensary is not available 24/7. Mess food may not be suitable for South students as the dishes are highly different, but good quality is maintained all over.",
              "Faculty": "Highly professional lecturers. A perfect curriculum is updated every year, and only relevant and useful subjects are taught. Semester exams in my college are very easy if you study hard. But it's difficult to get A+. However, it is possible. Low scorers can easily get good grades or pass marks if they start the preparation for exams even a week before.",

Top recruiting companies are American express, Amazon, Teradata, Intel, Dell, Intuit, Adobe, Steredian, Tekion, Pharma Easy etc. Most of the students got SDE roles. Many 2nd and 3rd year students got internships as problem setter, software developer etc. For the last year, the highest package was 60 LPA, the lowest was 7 LPA and the average was around 18 LPA.",
              "Infrastructure": "All hostels are well-equipped with high-speed LAN connections. The academic block has a high-speed Wi-Fi. The classrooms are air-conditioned with projector. Labs are well-equipped with necessary conponents. Library has a good collection of books related to the course and preparation for competitive exams. The mess food is hygienic and tastes good. The mess provides breakfast, lunch, snacks in the evening, dinner which is more than enough. The college has it's own dispensary which provides medicines for free. The campus has football ground, volleyball court, TT, badminton courts.",
              "Faculty": "All the teachers are well qualified and knowledgeable, though some are unable to deliver their knowledge properly. But they will definitely solve your doubts if you are really enthusiastic for the subject. The course curriculum is industry oriented, though you need to learn skills on your own. The semester exams are easy to pass but you need to work really hard to get a CGPA above 9.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because the AI era has already started. The best thing about this course is that it gives you the opportunity to learn about machine learning concepts and core CS concepts as well. The first 4 semesters are densely filled with courses, and the no. Of courses decreases in further semesters. It would be better to remove some unworthy courses like human values, environmental engineering, as it only tests how good you mug up. The college conducts decent technical as well as cultural events and fests. The campus crowd is well-balanced for healthy competition. And it's easy to get recognition if you work hard. The campus is located on the outskirts of city, though you can buy general items from the campus shops or the market located nearby."

The course curriculum keeps updating as per the industry requirements, but this is not enough for students to survive in the industry. We need to do some coding courses on an online platform to gain real-world insights. The passing percentage is quite good. It's nearly above 85%, and the exam pattern is also as per the education standards.",

              "Faculty": "Faculty-to-student ratio in my program is around 1:30 to 1:35. Most classes have a manageable number of students. It allows professors to give personal attention when needed. They are approachable outside of class hours and willing to help with doubts if you reach out politely. In my opinion, the course curriculum is excellent in terms of relevance and comprehensiveness. The university organizes activities based on real-world applications. It helps strengthen students’ skills. The teaching methods are consistent across all departments. However, the frequency and timing of exams are not very systematic."

The food quality is so poor that even the healthiest person can get sick. The college hosts multiple events on every national and special day. Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated for 10 days, which brings refreshment and spirituality among students."

This college is a savior for students with ranks below 60,000- 65,000. For CS/IT, the placement is average. If you are in the top 50%–60% of your class, you will get a minimum placement of 8–9 LPA, a maximum of 18 LPA or more, and the lowest around 3–6 LPA. Most students get jobs as the placement rate is above 90%.",

While second- and third-year classes are in the main building. Classroom infrastructure is average, with some air-conditioned rooms. Fourth-year classes are held in the Computer Science department, whose infrastructure is below average. A new extension for the CS department is being built, which will also accommodate IT students. Overall, the college infrastructure is average, similar to most state government universities.",
              "Faculty": "CSE and IT are the chillest courses in the college currently. Professors assign marks based on projects and give plenty of time for independent work. The curriculum is outdated. In the first year, students study irrelevant topics like paint and food technology. However, only the first year is difficult. Senior students say the other years are easy if you study regularly.",
              "Other": "This course is comparatively easier than others, but students must learn from other sources and cannot rely solely on the college. Teachers allow time for independent learning, which students should utilize. College events exist but are not very grand. Overall, they are above average. Fests such as the cultural fest Adhyay, the sports fest Agaz, and the technical fest are good and more than average."

              "Placements": "Around 70% students, who were eligible to sit in placements, got placed last year. The highest package is around 50 LPA, and the lowest can be expected as 3 LPA-4 LPA. The off-campus placement has even offered a 1 crore per annum package to a student. Internships are offered only to CSE students most of the time. However, the average stipend is around Rs. 30,000, but not all the students get internships on campus. The role you get solely depends on your skill level and your interview.",
              "Infrastructure": "The college does not have a huge campus area, but it is fine. Washrooms, rooms, ground, and labs are cleaned, proper lighting, AC rooms, titles over the floor and walls. Wi-Fi works well, the library is also well-maintained, and different types of books are available. However, the condition of the hostel is not very good, as the building is old, but the management tries to do everything to make it comfortable for the students. Mess food is also fine, the canteen menu is not too lengthy, but momos and spring rolls are tasty for sure.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are helpful and qualified, except for some of the guest faculty members. Most of the teachers are experienced, and their teaching style and knowledge are very impressive. Curriculum is relevant and focuses on making students industry-ready. Semester exams are not very difficult, but you have to give time to academics apart from learning skills. Even if you start 15 days before exams with full dedication, you can ace the exam easily. A CGPA of 5 or 45 marks out of 100 is the passing criteria for each subject.",
              "Other": "I chose CSE because this college provides a good placement rate for the CSE and IT branches. It is better than choosing a lower branch in another college. I think there should be more internship offers on the campus, so students do not have to search for internships. Annual fest Tarangana is held every year. Apart from this fest, many other activities and societies make the environment cheerful throughout the year. There are various sports clubs, dance clubs, singing clubs, and many more available."

Being in Delhi, connectivity is good, and the surroundings are safe. Scholarships and extracurricular activities are available but need more encouragement.

              "Other": "I chose this course just because of the placement at IGDTUW. The best thing about my course is that we can go for both sectors, hardware as well as software. The curriculum needs to be changed, and include some industry-level things, not only just assignments, files, and reports. Events are beneficial for the students who want to join them. The fest is good, and the campus crowd is okay. The connectivity is better, and the surroundings are good. They provide good scholarships according to fixed criteria. I got a Rs. 50,000 scholarship in my 2nd year. There is no specific sports complex."

              "Placements": "The placement ratio in my branch (MAE) is quite impressive, and 60-70% of students are getting placed. Even for core mechanical roles, the minimum package does not go below 5 LPA. In fact, I would say that the placement scenario for the mechanical course here is better than that of the CSE branch in many private colleges.",
              "Infrastructure": "Facilities and infrastructure are quite decent, with well-maintained classrooms equipped with AC. Currently, the only exception is the mechanical branch, which doesn't have AC yet. The hostel food used to be exceptionally tasty. Even though I am a day scholar, I often eat with my friends in the hostel because the food is genuinely delicious.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are very helpful, well-qualified, and highly knowledgeable. Most of them have completed their PhDs from premier institutes like IITs, so there is no doubt about the depth of their expertise. Semester exams are generally not too difficult to score well on. However, if we are in branches like Mechanical or ECE, we may need to put in a bit more effort compared to other branches. They say that with consistent hard work, even achieving a 10 CGPA is absolutely possible.",
              "Other": "Campus life is quite good. Although the campus area is relatively small compared to other JAC colleges. In my branch, there are around 120-130 students. The nearest metro station is near Kashmere Gate, and it takes barely 5 minutes to reach the college from there. The college has a wide range of societies, and we are encouraged to explore and get involved in as many as we would like. Personally, I have not been very active in other societies, as I have primarily focused on contributing to the training and placement cell, which is not categorised as a society."

Top recruiting companies for our course are Google, Wells Fargo, Infosys, Tata Motors, and Tata Advanced.",
              "Infrastructure": "There are two hostels, Krishna and Kaveri, with accommodation for 300 to 400 students. Rooms are allotted on the basis of distance. There is a facility of Wi-Fi and a common room for study purposes. The food quality is good. A variety of food is served for breakfast. Milk is constant, and cornflakes. There is no foundation.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are helpful. They explain very well. Lab sessions are also conducted, and they use a board for teaching purposes. The course curriculum is relevant, and it makes students industry-ready. Some companies allow for an industrial visit. There is no difficulty in college exams. The pass percentage in every subject is 45%.",
              "Other": "There are good placements in my course, so I chose it. There is hands-on experience in labs and cutting-edge technologies. Lab equipment is outdated, and the course structure is almost theoretical. Some events are organised by the college. There are 3 fests, i.e., technical, cultural, and sports fest. There is good connectivity 500 meters from the old Delhi railway station. Many scholarships are available."

Classrooms are very spacious, not all the classes are air-conditioned but many of them are. Library is very good. We have 24X7 open computer center. I am a day scholar so I can't say anything.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are very helpful and qualified. They are very supportive in helping students with their doubts, projects, and career related problems. They are very approachable as well. They are very knowledgeable in their respective subjects. They provide students with very good notes as well.

              "Faculty": "Teachers are helpful and knowledgeable. They teach well. Some professors are very helpful. They help with research papers and more. They are also easily reachable. I feel our course is very relevant and everything we need to know for good placements. The level of exams is average. They are not too easy, not too tough. Maintaining a GPA above 8 is manageable.",
              "Other": "So it is very relevant and has good placements. IGDTUW has a good alumni network, and students get placed in good companies like Microsoft, Adobe, etc. Seniors are also very helpful, providing great exposure to everything.

              "Placements": "Almost 70–80 percent of students get placed. The highest package is 15 LPA, and the lowest package is 2 LPA. Recruiting organizations include some universities and hospitals. Roles offered are professor and physiotherapist roles in sports, neuro, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular specializations. Many alumni start working abroad, and we have a wide range of options for how we want to work.",
              "Infrastructure": "Infrastructure is above average, and we can rate it 4/10. Some cons include lift issues and Wi-Fi speed. Labs have almost all the required equipment. Hostel facilities are average. They charge a high amount, but facilities are not worth it. Mess and canteen are available, and their prices are reasonable. Medical facilities are good, as we have a hospital and a rehabilitation centre. In sports, we have football, volleyball, badminton, basketball, cricket, table tennis, carrom, and chess. We need improvement in all these areas.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are really helpful and friendly, with experience. They graduate from Jamia Hamdard and other colleges in Delhi and have completed their Master's in different fields of physiotherapy. The course curriculum is relevant, as they teach practical work, which is very important. We give only final exams like MBBS. The pass percentage is 50%, which becomes harder if we do not take it seriously.",
              "Other": "I always wanted to be a doctor, so I chose BPT, through which I can help people who want to live better lives. Things that can be improved include infrastructure, and in our course, we always need improvements, as everything is now modified. Events are organized frequently, and we can join the fests of other departments. The crowd is friendly, and the college is ragging-free. Campus surroundings are manageable for living. Scholarships are available for toppers, SC, ST, and minorities."

              "Placements": "As much as I have heard, the placement records are not very high. Teachers help in getting you placed, but it is your job to find a good job, and very few students get placed from the college itself. 30 percent of the students get placed maybe much less as specific records aren't mentioned. The highest package is 10 LPA, the lowest is 2.8 LPA, and the average is 3 LPA-4.5 LPA. Several companies such as HCL, Tata, Coca-Cola, and others. From my course 70 percent of students got internships Roles that are offered are data analyst, customer executive, salesforce, managerial roles, etc.",
              "Infrastructure": "Wi-Fi service is available, but it rarely works, and data services are negligible here. A lot of issues arise because of that. Classrooms are normal college classrooms with no AC and old fans. The library is functional with a huge number of books but most are outdated. The hostel facilities are great with good rooms, AC, and water supply. The curfew time is 9:30 PM, and the food is a bit hygienic, but not that bad. The sports facilities are great with a huge ground available, and other sports equipment is also available.",
              "Faculty": "My department has knowledgeable and supportive faculty who help in building a good foundation which is essential. The syllabus is not that up to date but it isn't obsolete either. It has subjects like principles of management, states, indian economy, business economy, etc. If you want to be industry-ready, then you have to seek internships and real-life experiences on your own. Semester exams are manageable if you study properly. The overall pass rate is high with 40 percent being required to pass from both internal and external.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because I was always intrigued by management and how businesses worked, and all the plethora of things that go on in the background. I would add more skills that I can learn to make students job-ready. Fewer major events are conducted. The crowd is mixed but not very bright. Connectivity is mid, the closest metro station is Govindpuri and Nehru Place, from there you can take an auto. The campus is great it's built on almost 100 acres with fewer scholarship opportunities and moderate activities."

              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure is no doubt top-notch. The only issue is they are taking bulk student intake, which affects the mess being jammed-packed some days. The library during exam times is crowded, you won't find seats there, but on exam days it is good.",
              "Faculty": "The curriculum is well-structured, but the execution is not so good. Our institute lacks very well-qualified faculty members, but there are a few (2-3) very good facilities too. Semester exams are easy, you don't have to worry about them. The extracurricular activities are 2/5 as well.",
              "Other": "If you get into this college, it's not too bad, but you have to earn skills and get a job. Because there is not so much well-structured placement support, the management does try to give you whatever is the best of their knowledge, but sometimes they fail to understand what a student needs. There are some unusual restrictions that you might have to deal with. Overall, I would rate my college 2.5/5."

Some teachers are really good, but they leave the college early for better jobs, so we're stuck with the bad ones.

What I liked best is that the course gives you both theoretical knowledge and chances to practice it, which is important in CST. Some subjects still feel too theory-oriented and could be updated with more industry-level case studies. The teaching quality is good overall, but if every professor included more hands-on coding sessions, it would make the learning process more engaging. The college organizes both technical and cultural fests. The crowd is friendly and supportive; you will find people from different states, and it's easy to make connections."

Course should be more core informative to the updated environment and technologies developed till now. It also includes events, fests like in our college, there is an event that is held every year, e.g, Majistic 2k25, which happened this year, and not only this, there are many clubs and extracurricular activities in the college that make a student more active and participating."

              "Placements": "Hi, from a CSE student here at JIS College in Kalyani. Our placement scene is pretty solid. You can expect around an 85-90 percent placement rate mostly with big IT companies like TCS, Cognizant and Wipro. The average salary package is a decent start typically between 4.5 LPA and 5.5 LPA. While a few top coders manage to bag high offers around 14 LPA that requires serious personal effort. Most of us start as software engineers. Honesty, the college gets you the opportunities, it's up to you to build your skills and crack them.",
              "Infrastructure": "As a CSE student at JIS, I would say our facilities get the job done. The labs are pretty good and our library is well-stocked. It's where everyone is heading now that classes are over for the day. Wi-Fi can be a bit unreliable outside of those spots, though. Life after class is what you would expect, hostel rooms are basic and the mess food gets repetitive fast, which is why the canteen is always busy.",
              "Faculty": "Honestly, the academics here are what you make of them. Most of our teachers are qualified and knowledgeable, but the teaching quality is a mixed bag. Some are fantastic while others just stick to the slides. They are helpful if you approach them, though. The curriculum follows the standard MAKAUT syllabus, so it covers the fundamentals well but it's not always up to date. You definitely have to learn new technologies on your own to be truly industry ready. Semester exams aren't too difficult, if you study the notes and previous year's questions, you will be fine. The pass percentage is pretty high, probably over 90 percent.",
              "Other": "I chose CSE for jobs. Best part is the labs where coding feels real. Wish the curriculum were less theoretical and more modern with topics like AI/cloud. It follows the old university syllabus, so self-study is a must for getting industry-ready. Campus life is fun, our fests are the highlight. The crowd is cool, you will find your people. Kalyani is quiet but well-connected by train. There are scholarships and student-run clubs for coding, photography, etc., which is how most of us unwind after class."

The quality of hostel food is moderate not too bad contains four meals and hostels also have medical support 24/7, including outdoor and indoor games.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are too helpful and knowledgeable and supportive teaching is also well and good. The course curriculum is relevant and students are ready for industrial and corporate jobs and other upcoming opportunities. Semester exams are a little bit difficult and you have to score 21 out of 70 in the semester exam to pass the exam."

But as of now, the placement condition is too bad. Big companies are not coming to recruit, the average is only 4 LPA-6 LPA. But I am hoping that in the Next 3-4 years, the placement ratio will improve, and even big companies can also recruit.",
              "Infrastructure": "For infrastructure, I would say neither is too good like IIT, NIT, IIMs infra, nor too bad like other tier-2 colleges. Hostel infrastructure is better both for boys and girls. Even though the capacity is low and the buildings are old, it is a better place for B.Tech students.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty is good, some coaches are from the Bengaluru campus. Curriculum is outdated, as it is according to the AKTU affiliation. There is no proper coding subject for CSE students in the 1st year due to AKTU. If I talk about exams, it reverts to AKTU as if I talk about mine, my first semester exams were postponed 2-3 times.",
              "Other": "I chose the AIML course as I have an interest in it, and also, currently, it is the best course according to my current tech background. I wish to be more focused on skill-based subjects than the old academic curriculum, as there should be more Java, Python, DSA subjects, and workshops. But the crowd and campus life are not so good as there are very few fests, events, etc."

              "Faculty": "Faculty is same as all other colleges. First-year college faculty is a little serious, but from the second year, it's very chill. It's AKTU affiliated, so the curriculum is outdated. Semester exams are not difficult, but again, it's AKTU, you can never be sure about your performance. Even if you attempt all the questions, you might get the subject back, so it’s very common in all AKTU-affiliated colleges, and it happens very often.",

Semester exams are very tough. As a result, they follow 30 internal and 70 external marks criteria for theory exams and 50-50 for practicals. You need to score 21/70 to pass and in internals 19/30 and in total, your score must be 40/100 to pass.",

The main CSE building, Golden Jubilee Bhavan, and the admin block are great, but the rest of the buildings are pretty average. For freshers, they conduct classes in the Polymer Science building, whose classrooms are pretty bad. They really need to improve it.",

Although this number will grow because the placement season is still going on. The median package you can expect from this college if you are in the CSE branch is about 8 LPA but if you work a little hard, then you can get 13 LPA to 20 LPA, it all depends on you.",
              "Infrastructure": "There is Wi-Fi, a library, big playgrounds, multiple canteens, labs, and the area of the whole campus is 104 acres. There is a lot of greenery as well, so I would say the infrastructure is good. There is a gym that is free, and there is a big cricket ground, a football ground, and a basketball court. There are a lot of places where you can hang out with your friends, and the classrooms have projectors.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty is nice, cooperative, and well-educated. The curriculum is the same as that of any other college and unchanged from the old one. The teachers do tend to say some important things in Kannada otherwise, the whole lecture is in English. There are multiple clubs in which you can participate. There is one thing that I don't like about this college, and that is its strictness regarding attendance. You don't get a lot of days off here, but this is a subjective flaw.",
              "Other": "There is a shortage of hostel rooms inside the campus, so there is an outside campus hostel called the Shivratri hostel, and even after that, some students don't get a room there, also showing they have to live in PG outside campus. This only happens in 1st year because all the students of 2nd year and higher get a hostel room. Since they have increased the intake this year, this is happening. If you take admission early, you don't have to worry about any of this."

Some part of the course curriculum need to be changed, apart from that, the curriculum will make students industry ready. The difficulty level of the exams is medium, but the exams and evaluation process are very strict.",
              "Other": "After completing my Bachelors, I chose this course to gain more knowledge about my field and secure a good and high-paying job. One thing, there will be only a major project during the last semester, no theory subjects, so it kind of became lengthy and boring, like not going to college and attending the classes, just do the project and get it reviewed whenever the guide will call us."

Top recruiting companies included TCS, Infosys, Wipro, LTIMindtree, Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant, and Bosch.

Our department had Wi-Fi-enabled labs, updated computer systems, spacious classrooms, a digital library, and access to the main library with thousands of books and journals. Hostel facilities were decent with clean rooms, study areas, indoor games, and 24/7 security. The mess food was manageable, and the canteen options were better with snacks and meals available throughout the day. The campus also has sports grounds, a health center, gyms, and plenty of greenery, which makes student life comfortable.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty members in the MCA department were very supportive, highly qualified, and explained concepts clearly. Most teachers were approachable and helped with projects, coding doubts, and placements.\nThe curriculum is updated and relevant to industry needs, especially with subjects in programming, databases, machine learning, web tech, and project development.\nSemester exams were of moderate difficulty, and as long as students attended classes and prepared regularly, passing was not very hard. The pass percentage was consistently good.",
              "Other": "I chose MCA at SJCE because of its strong reputation, experienced faculty, and placement record. The best part of the course was the hands-on labs, coding-based learning, and helpful teachers. I wish there were more industry-driven workshops, but overall, the learning experience was great. The campus environment, greenery, events, and student community made my time here memorable. It is a very student-friendly college with plenty of extracurricular opportunities."

The campus is clean and has a peaceful atmosphere. However, more campus placement opportunities and technical workshops would improve the experience. The college organizes some cultural and technical events, but I wish there were more extracurricular activities and festival celebrations. The campus is well connected by road, and transportation is easily available."

The one thing I want the college to improve is the food in the hostel. It was not very bad, but it needs better discipline. That was the only problem, otherwise, everything was good."
